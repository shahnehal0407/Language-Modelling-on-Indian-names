# Assignment 2: Language Modelling (TA: Yash Patel)

The goal of this assignment is to model city names using character-level language models.

Please make a copy of this notebook (locally or on Colab). Ensure you adhere to the guidelines and submission instructions (mentioned below) for attempting and submitting the assignment.

Given that the class has 150+ students, we will **NOT** entertain any requests for changing your notebooks after the submission deadline (especially in cases when the notebook fails to compile or run because you did not follow the instructions).

### Guidelines for Attempting the Assignment

1. Write your logic in the cells **ONLY** which have the comment `# ADD YOUR CODE HERE`, between the `# BEGIN CODE` and `# END CODE` comments. These cells are also demarcated by the special start (`## ==== BEGIN EVALUATION PORTION`) and end (`## ==== END EVALUATION PORTION`) comments. Do **NOT** remove any of these comments from the designated cells, otherwise your assignment will not be evaluated correctly.

2. Write your code **ONLY** in the cells designated for auto-evaluation, between the `# BEGIN CODE` and `# END CODE` comments. Please don't write any extra code or comments anywhere else.

3. All imports that should be necessary are already provided as part of the notebook. You should **NOT** import any new libraries, otherwise your assignment will not be graded.

4. You need to install the libraries/imports used in this notebook yourself. Its recommended to use python version between 3.9 and 3.11 to attempt this assignment.

5. **If you encounter any errors in the supporting cells during execution, contact the respective TAs.**

6. **Please read the function docs and comments carefully**. They provide specific instructions and examples for implementing each function. Follow these instructions precisely - neither oversimplify nor overcomplicate your implementations. Deviating from the provided implementation guidelines may result in lost marks.

7. **Important**: Use of AI-assistive technologies such as ChatGPT or GitHub CoPilot is not permitted for this assignment. Ensure that all attempts are solely your own. Not following this rule can incur a large penalty, including but not limited to scoring a zero for this assignment.

## Submission Instructions

Note that your assignment will be marked based on the results obtained by functions implemented by you. Do not change the print statements having `EVALUATION` as they are used for auto-evaluation.

You'd need to submit the following files:

  * Save this `.ipynb` to your drive, complete the required code blocks and run the notebook.

  * After completing this assignment, download the notebook as`.py`. Name it as `SAPname_SRno_assignment2.py`, where `SAPname` refers to your name as per SAP record, and `SRno` refers to the last 5 digits of your IISc SR number. For example, IISc student with SAP name Twyla Linda (SR no - 04-03-00-10-22-20-1-15329) would name it as `Twyla_Linda_15329_assignment2.py`.

  *   The files associated with FNN and RNN models i.e. `model.pt`, `vocab.pt` and `loss.json` will be downloaded and saved in folders with names `fnn` and `rnn` respectively, and these will be contained within folder `SAPname_SRno`. Zip this folder along with the `.py` file, save it as `SAPname_SRno_assignment2` and upload on MS Teams. The directory can be summarised as follows:

```
SAPname_SRno_assignment2
│   SAPname_SRno_assignment2.py  
│
└───SAPname_SRno
│   │
│   └───fnn
│   │   │   model.pt
│   │   │   vocab.pt
│   │   │   loss.json
│   │
│   └───rnn
│       │   model.pt
│       │   vocab.pt
│       │   loss.json

```

Because submissions are auto-graded, please ensure that the naming of the files is consistent with the instructions.

### Marks Distribution

- Neural N-gram LM: 25
- RNN LM: 30

In the cell below, replace `SAPName` with your name as per SAP record, and `SRNo` with the last 5 digits of your IISc SR number. For example, IISc student with SAP name Twyla Linda (SR no - 04-03-00-10-22-20-1-15329) would use:

```python
STUDENT_SAP_NAME  = "Twyla Linda"

"""Now it's time to implement an [n-gram language model](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/3.pdf).

One edge case you will need to handle is that you don't have $n-1$ prior characters at the beginning of the text.  One way to do this is by appending the `START` token $n-1$ times at the start of the name, when implementing an $n$-gram model. You may choose whichever method you like to handle this case as long as you produce a valid probability distribution (one that sums to one).

**Generating names**

To generate from a language model, we can sample one char at a time conditioning on the chars we have generated so far.

In fact there are many strategies to get better-sounding samples, such as only sampling from the top-k chars or sharpening the distribution with a temperature.  You can read more about sampling from a language model in [this](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.09751.pdf) paper.


We will now implement N-gram models with $N=1$ (unigram), $N=2$ (bigram), and $N=3$ (trigram).

**Utility Functions**

Implement the utility functions `get_unigram_counts`, `get_bigram_counts` and `get_trigram_counts`. You can use these functions while implementing n-gram models.

        Computes conditional probability distributions P(current_char | prev_char) for each position in words.

        This method analyzes character sequences in the training data to calculate position-specific
        transition probabilities between consecutive characters (bigrams). For each position, it computes
        the probability of seeing a character given the previous character, only including previous characters
        that actually occur at the respective positions in the training data.

        Args:
            max_position (int, optional): Maximum number of positions to analyze, starting from position 1.
                For example, if max_position=3, computes probabilities for positions 1, 2, and 3.
                Defaults to 5.

        Returns:
            list[dict]: A list of nested dictionaries where:
                - Index i contains transitions for position i+1
                - Outer dictionary keys are previous characters that occur at position i
                - Inner dictionary keys are current characters with their conditional probabilities
                - Format: [{prev_char: {current_char: probability}}]
                - All probabilities for a given prev_char sum to 1.0

        Character Handling:
            - All characters in vocabulary including special tokens (<s>, </s>, <UNK>)
            - Only include previous characters that actually occur at the respective positions
            - First position always includes '<s>' as previous character

        Example:
            >>> model.get_position_specific_probabilities(2)
            [
                {
                    '<s>': {'a': 0.3, 'b': 0.1, 'c': 0.2, 'd': 0.05, 'e': 0.1, ...}     # Position 1
                    # Only <s> as it's the only valid previous character for first position
                },
                {
                    'a': {'a': 0.05, 'b': 0.1, 'c': 0.2, 'd': 0.09, 'e': 0.15, 'f': 0.1, ...},      # Position 2
                    'b': {'a': 0.2, 'b': 0.04, 'c': 0.2, 'd': 0.05, 'e': 0.05, 'f': 0.2, ...}, ...

              in the training data (e.g., position 1 for predicting position 2)
            - Probabilities are computed from training data frequencies
            - Each inner dictionary should contain probabilities for all possible next characters
            - The sum of probabilities for each valid prev_char should equal 1.0

        """
        Computes conditional probability distributions P(current_char | prev_char1, prev_char2) for each position in words.

        This method analyzes character sequences in the training data to calculate position-specific
        transition probabilities between three consecutive characters (trigrams). For each position, it computes
        the probability of seeing a character given the previous two characters, with the previous two characters comprising only including character pairs
        that actually occur at the respective positions in the training data.

        Args:
            max_position (int, optional): Maximum number of positions to analyze, starting from position 1.
                For example, if max_position=3, computes probabilities for positions 1, 2, and 3.
                Defaults to 5.

        Returns:
            list[dict]: A list of nested dictionaries where:
                - Index i contains transitions for position i+1
                - Outer dictionary keys are tuples of previous two characters that occur at positions (i-1, i)
                - Inner dictionary keys are current characters with their conditional probabilities
                - Format: [{(prev_char1, prev_char2): {current_char: probability}}]
                - All probabilities for a given (prev_char1, prev_char2) pair sum to 1.0

        Character Handling:
            - First position uses ('<s>', '<s>') as previous characters
            - Second position uses ('<s>', char1) as previous characters
            - Only include character pairs that actually occur at the respective positions

In this section, you will implement a neural version of an n-gram model.  The model will use a simple feedforward neural network that takes the previous `n-1` chars and outputs a distribution over the next char.

You will use PyTorch to implement the model.  We've provided a little bit of code to help with the data loading using [PyTorch's data loaders](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html)

"""#### FNN Implementation

**Feed-forward Neural Language Modelling**

Like the n-gram LM, the feedforward neural LM approximates the probability of a char given the entire prior context $P(w_t|w_{1:t−1})$ by approximating based on the $N-1$ previous chars:
$$P(w_t|w_1,...,w_{t−1}) ≈ P(w_t|w_{t−N+1},...,w_{t−1})$$


Implement the FNN LM given in this paper: [Neural Probabilistic Language Model](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/bengio03a/bengio03a.pdf)

The architecture of the FNN can be described by the equation and figure:

$$y = b + W x + U \text t \text a \text n \text h (d + H x)$$

- $x$ is of size $(ngram-1)*m$ where $m$ is the size embedding dimensions
- $y$ is of size $V*1$ where $V$ is the vocabulary size

![FNN_LM](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1aQhkXjWelHfiBfmBQV3z5TjHFNMtqtzT)


**Some tips**:
- embed the chars with dimension $m$ (example, $60$), then flatten into a single embedding for  $n-1$  chars (with size  $(n-1)*m$ )
- you can use Adam or Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) for optimising the cross entropy loss
- If you are using SGD, you may want to use momentum, and a learning rate scheduler
- do early stopping based on validation set loss or perplexity

**Important**: Fix seed as 42 whenever performing any randomized operations, e.g., initializing ML models.
